## 🎯 Project Overview

The **Movie Analytics Platform (MAP)** is an end-to-end big data analytics solution designed to transform how movie data is evaluated. By integrating large-scale datasets with sentiment analysis, financial modeling, and interactive visualization, MAP provides deeper insights into **movie performance and audience emotional engagement**.

Unlike traditional rating-based analysis, this platform uncovers how audiences *feel* about movies, revealing insights that ratings alone fail to capture.

---

## 🧠 Business Goals

* Analyze over **1 million movie records** efficiently
* Compare **financial performance** using inflation-adjusted metrics
* Identify discrepancies between **ratings and sentiment**
* Enhance decision-making using **interactive dashboards**
* Apply **big data engineering and analytics techniques**

---

## 📂 Data Sources

* **IMDb (Internet Movie Database)**
* **TMDB (The Movie Database)**

## 🧠 Sentiment Analysis

### Sentiment Categorization

Sentiment scores were classified into intuitive categories:

| Score Range | Category    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| -1.0        | Disastrous  |
| -0.5        | Terrible    |
| 0.0         | Neutral     |
| 0.5         | Enjoyable   |
| 1.0         | Masterpiece |

### Advanced Sentiment Processing

* Conducted using **JMP Pro 17**
* Word-level sentiment impact analysis
* Identified emotional drivers beyond numerical ratings

---

## 🔮 Predictive Modeling

* Logistic Regression model
* Sample size: **100 randomly selected movies**
* Binary sentiment classification:

  * **In Favor** (positive emotion)
  * **Opposed** (negative emotion)

### Text Analysis

* Word clouds generated using Text Explorer
* Frequently used words analyzed for sentiment influence

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

✔ High-rated movies often showed **lower sentiment scores**
✔ Low-rated movies sometimes evoked **strong emotional engagement**
✔ Ratings do not always reflect audience emotion
✔ Sentiment captures nuances that ratings miss

These findings suggest emotional response and critical rating are not always aligned.
